    Provides piped, buffered access to PG COPY binary stream.
    To use:
        __init__, providing table and cursor to execute PG COPY on. Please note,
            the cursor will be shared with worker thread until close() is called.
        Call open() to initialize.
        Call append() to write data to the pipe. Please note there will be some
            cost for write() syscall, so it is advised to batch the data in
            chunks
        When all is written - call close() to finalize the transfer. It is not
            allowed to use object after close() was called
        Don't forget to call commit() on connection :D
